to check logs:


there are two ways - either you check the logs via command line:
I typically do then kubectl logs <pod> -c>container> --tail 200 -f   
(you can also do icdctl instead of kubectl).

You can also use logdna
I then do icdctl logdna after I selected a formation.
i logs --tail 100 c-$ID-m-0 -c db


to access icd 
login to ibm cloud

 ibmcloud login --sso 
 paste the one time password
 
 chose number 9
 if you have issues 
 
 try update icd   
 icdctl update. ; or 
 token refresh icdctl refresh-tokens

 
 to log in to the deployment
 
 i ffs 8e8d21a0-b715-4ed4-9e15-1ec4d1c70484  or
 
 i ffs crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-mongodb:eu-de:a/6202fc75353041f6aa259712bb03cde5:
 dc7d2463-5822-49b2-ad37-c28e199c3b7a::

icdctl console <pods>

icdctl describe <pod>

will give you more info , if you get connected , write pcs shows status

i check-scale   will tel you if there is any resources issue

For rabbitmq 
Run  i rqcs 

Postgres check disk usage:
i prf

i recs   redis formation

Failed provisioning
i recipe-fail the provision recipe this will allow you delete it

i check-scale 
checks to see if deployment needs to be scaled

i get pvc -o yaml | grep storage
      volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: icd-block-gold

Used space
i console m-0 -- "df -h /data" | grep pvc

i console m-1 -- "df -h /data" | grep pvc


`icdctl cluster` to see a list of all of the clusters we manage.

you can do i clusters (if you have set i as an alias)
`i cl <cluster-name>`or icdctl cl <cluster nasme>
i g po will run and A pod is a Kubernetes construct that represents a group of containers running on a node

you can use the `d` to describe for example 
i d po icd-scheduler-84fd8b65c9-8s522

You can target a namespace with `icdctl namespace <name>` (`i ns <name>`), or try `icdctl get 
formations --all-namespaces` to view all formations across all namespaces instead:

To get more detail about one formation in particular, use `icdctl formation <name>` (`i f <name>`):

we can use the formation parameter as well to check individual account :
you can run `icdctl formation <name>` (`i f <name>`) to target it and get the above information.

i ce status` will run a health check
i ce is_leader` will tell you which member is the leader

You can get pod logs by tailing them (`i tail m-0`) or pulling them directly (`icdctl logs c-$ID-m-0 --since 24h`). 
Either way you'll need to specify which container you care about (`-c db` or `-c mgmt`).
