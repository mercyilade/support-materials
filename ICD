to access icd 

`icdctl cluster` to see a list of all of the clusters we manage.

you can do i clusters (if you have set i as an alias)
`i cl <cluster-name>`or icdctl cl <cluster nasme>
i g po will run and A pod is a Kubernetes construct that represents a group of containers running on a node

you can use the `d` to describe for example 
i d po icd-scheduler-84fd8b65c9-8s522

You can target a namespace with `icdctl namespace <name>` (`i ns <name>`), or try `icdctl get 
formations --all-namespaces` to view all formations across all namespaces instead:

To get more detail about one formation in particular, use `icdctl formation <name>` (`i f <name>`):

we can use the formation parameter as well to check individual account :
you can run `icdctl formation <name>` (`i f <name>`) to target it and get the above information.

i ce status` will run a health check
i ce is_leader` will tell you which member is the leader

You can get pod logs by tailing them (`i tail m-0`) or pulling them directly (`icdctl logs c-$ID-m-0 --since 24h`). 
Either way you'll need to specify which container you care about (`-c db` or `-c mgmt`).
