If you are having a problem updating your clou, follow these steps 


remove your old venv before starting 
my old one is (clou_project)

create a new directory using mkdir 
example mkdir testing
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
. venv/bin/activate

pip install -i https://mercyilade@uk.ibm.com:"api"
@eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/pypi/wdp-cloumpose-pypi-virtual/simple clou

gotten from : https://eu.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/webapp/#/home

after that clou is installed
you will encounter permission issue :

testing clou --version
zsh: permission denied: /Users/mercyilade/venvs/clou/bin/clou

you need to change your clou path either by script or in the ~/.zshrc(change it to the new directory you created)

change the clou alias in the file above

after that do source ~/.zshrc to build up the changes

test by doing clou --version
you will see 3.0

try clou user info $name

error message saying 
 import idna
ImportError: No module named idna

do pip install idna

complete and clou is working
