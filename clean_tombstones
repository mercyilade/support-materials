question


My team was wondering about the possibility of this scenario working:

Imagine we have a user database called user-1234.

At some point, we want to clean up the tombstones in that user database, so we replicate the data - 
excluding the tombstones - to a new database called user-1234-new.

After that happens, is there any way we can configure Cloudant to pass any calls to user-1234 along to user-1234-new, 
either by a 3xx redirect or some other technique?


Response

ou would have to implement a redirect at the application side, as Cloudant does not offer this functionality.

Generally speaking, when creating a new database as part of conflict cleanup, there are two options:

A) When the replication from old -> new databases is complete and you have verified that the new database contains all desired data, do the following:

- Change your application code to point to the new database ('user-1234-new').
- Delete the original database ('user-1234').

B) Or, if you want to retain the original name of the database, do the following:

- Change your application code to point to the new database ('user-1234-new').
- Delete the original database ('user-1234') and recreate a new database with the same name ('user-1234').
- Replicate from the new database ('user-1234-new') to the database that you just recreated ('user-1234').
- Verify that the recreated database with the original name ('user-1234') contains all desired data and change 
your application code to point this database.
- Delete the 'user-1234-new' database.

More information on how to do this is available in the "Simple removal of 'tombstone' documents" 
section of the documentation linked below.
