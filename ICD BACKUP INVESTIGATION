When a customer reports a backup is failing for Mongodb

check if they have enough resources
check if there is any notes when you check on the formation
If it's a Mongodb failing check if there is an issue with the oplog size or mgmt memory
 i logs c-$ID-h-0 -cmgmt --since=24h > Log1.txt
âžœi logs c-$ID-h-0 -cdb  --since=24h > Log2.txt 

or 
 i logs c-$ID-h-0 -cdb  --previous  > log2.txt    
  i logs c-$ID-h-0 -cmgmt  --previous  > log2.txt   
  
  from Logdna:
  'icdctl l -p h-0 -c mgmt

or
 icdctl l -p h-0 -c db

check if there is any issue with files being shipped to COS
check for something like this in the logs "upload: '<stdin>' if it failed 



For Postgres first check this link:
https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibm-cloud-databases/runbooks/guides/backup-failures/postgresql.html
and see if it tallies as to what is the issue

see if you can get something like this 
upload: '<stdin>' -> 's3://17e6c4bf-9501-4ce3-a67c-e24295ddbd8f/17e6c4bf-9501-4ce3-a67c-e24295ddbd8f-20201114-002116.tar.lz4'  [part 3739, 50MB]
