How to get old revision numbers 

if it is not there 

 old revisions remain available only as long as it takes for compaction to run again on the cluster. 
 That time period can be anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours depending on the configuration and workload 
 for the cluster. In general though, if you update a document, you should treat old revisions as gone.
 If your application has a need to keep old versions of documents around, we recommend using immutable documents 
 that can be referenced later.
