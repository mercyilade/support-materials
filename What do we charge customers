When customers ask what they are charged for ?

 we charge customers for storage based on the sizes.external figure returned by GET /db
 for example 
 
 acurl -s https://4c6e48e1-f77b-454b-b086-1a62e2601266-bluemix.cloudant.com/xaas-queue | jq .
 
 "purge_seq": 0,
  "sizes": {
    "file": 3493146500,
    "external": 2319765815, -> this is what we charge the customer . size.external 
    "active": 1877914278
  },
  "props": {},
  "other": {
    "data_size": 2319765815
  },
  "doc_del_count": 2028494,
  "doc_count": 13,
  "disk_size": 3493146500,
  "disk_format_version": 8,
  "data_size": 1877914278,
  "compact_running": false,
  "cluster": {
    "q": 16,
    
    The reason why your disk storage size might be higher than you expect could be because the space taken up 
    by deleted documents counts towards the database size.

In your database, although I found few (4) non-deleted documents (doc_count) there are many
(1991816) deleted documents (doc_del_count), as seen in this outout of the the "GET /$DATABASE"
API (the API is described at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-databases#getting-database-details).
The figure on which billing for Cloudant storage is based is what appears in the .sizes.external field (2281863751 bytes in the above output).
By the way, that is a different figure from what appears in the Size column of the Databases panel of the Cloudant dashboard.

When you delete a document using the "DELETE /$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID" API (described at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/
Cloudant?topic=cloudant-documents#delete-a-document), that leaves a tombstome that includes only the _id, _rev and _deleted 
fields which takes up minimal disk space. However, in your database I see at least one deleted document that has more than 
just those tombstone fields:
