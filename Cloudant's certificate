Cloudant's certificate is signed by a universally trusted Certificate Authority that is pre-trusted by 
all browsers, operating systems, and other software systems like the JDK.

Cloudant commits to always publishing a valid (non-expired) TLS certificate signed by a universally
trusted Certificate Authority.

All customers are strongly discouraged from pinning the current certificate, which is subject to 
expiration and prompt rotation in the event of compromise.

We therefore recommend that customers use the default certificate bundles for their operating systems 
and browsers, which will ensure continued secure service through any certificate changes
