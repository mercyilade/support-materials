If a customer ask when indexing will be completed .
use this formula to calculate it

this is my calculation
changes pending 7.20   15mil
changes pending 8.00    10mil


index processed in 40mins = 5mil

rate of indexing (change process per min )5000000/40
=125000

time to complete indexing  
10mil/125000 =80mins 


changes pending first time stamp 
-
changes pending second time stamp

= indexed processed in minutes

Rate of indexing = indexed processed in mins/difference in timestamps

time to complete indexing ==second changes pending/rate of indexing 

again this is an estimate all things being equal 

for better accuracy take a larger sample.
