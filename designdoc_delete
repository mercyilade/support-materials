How to check if a design doc is deleted:

You can check splunk and see if there is a delete request for the account: if there is it will come up in the r
esults from splunk 

example of the splunk command 

index=ibm-smarterworkforce001* account_name=swfscpub db_name=tfp_master http_method=DELETE 
sc_dd_exportCache earliest=03/01/2019:00:00:00

check also if there is any PUT request to recreate the desing doc :

index=ibm-smarterworkforce001* account_name=swfscpub db_name=tfp_master 
http_method=PUT sc_dd_exportCache earliest=03/01/2019:00:00:00



index="ibm-smarterworkforce001*" _design/sc_dd_exportCache db_name=tfp_master account_name=swfscpub 
| timechart span=1d count by status_code

index="ibm-smarterworkforce001*" _design/sc_dd_exportCache db_name=tfp_master account_name=swfscpub  http_method=POST OR  
http_method=PUT | timechart  span=2h count by status_code

If there is no hit , get back to the customer and ask if they can provide time stamps when the delete occurred.
