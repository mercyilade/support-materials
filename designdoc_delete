How to check if a design doc is deleted:

You can check splunk and see if there is a delete request for the account: if there is it will come up in the r
esults from splunk 

example of the splunk command 

index=ibm-smarterworkforce001* account_name=swfscpub db_name=tfp_master http_method=DELETE 
sc_dd_exportCache earliest=03/01/2019:00:00:00

check also if there is any PUT request to recreate the desing doc :

index=ibm-smarterworkforce001* account_name=swfscpub db_name=tfp_master 
http_method=PUT sc_dd_exportCache earliest=03/01/2019:00:00:00

If there is no hit , get back to the customer and ask if they can provide time stamps when the delete occurred.
