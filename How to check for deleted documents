When a customer complains a document have been deleted, we can check in splunk and also check 
the splunk history to find out if the documents have been deleted .
checkin g the revs history:

acurl -s https://ac9feebb-1d47-4ab0-99ab-5b44900e6d3f-bluemix.cloudant.com/$name of DB/$name of document?revs_info=true&deleted=true | jq .
pick the latest rev and check if you can see if it is actually deleted :

acurl -s https://ac9feebb-1d47-4ab0-99ab-5b44900e6d3f-bluemix.cloudant.com/mldeployment-prod/bdfe2457-ef6b-40c5-9cf5-195a1313f8e4?rev=3-9807061843fadb671412337183b67172 | jq .

splunk will also show if it is deleted but if it is not displayed in splunk  it means a bulk delete was made

If nothing is found, check if there was an y _bulk_docs operation although Haproxy does not log the response body

index=thirdiron001* NOT _changes browzine user-2419b700-e268-11e6-aebe-0b170618485f NOT GET NOT HEAD NOT _local _bulk_docs

ask the customer if they made any _bulk_docs operation
