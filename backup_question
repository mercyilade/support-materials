When asked about deprecated backup

 To start with, we no longer support the enterprise backup strategy you're employing here. That feature never made 
 it out of beta and we're no longer able to create new backup schedules internally. 
 This does not affect any currently running schedules, if you have any before

Going forward backups are meant to be handled self service on the client side idealy using Couchbackup following the 
steps outlined in our documentation seen here (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/guides/
backup-cookbook.html#cloudant-backup-and-recovery).

On to the questions:

1. The legacy backup solution you're using does not support rolling forward. It supports point-in-time restores, 
but nothing more intricate than that.
2. No, the backup solution leverages Cloudant replication to roll a database back to an

individual point in time. While it is incremental, and will only replicate the delta between two points in time,
it cannot operate at a more granular level than that.
