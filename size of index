To track index size statistics, you will want to use the '_info' endpoint, which is documented in the link provided below.

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/api/design_documents.html#retrieving-information-about-a-design-document

To do this, simply make a request of the form shown below, substituting the appropriate values for $ACCOUNT, $DATABASE, 
and $DESIGN-DOC.

curl https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/$DESIGN-DOC/_info

Then, use the 'disk_size' statistic (size in bytes of the view as stored on disk) to evaluate the size 
of your indexes over time.
