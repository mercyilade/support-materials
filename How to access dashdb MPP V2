In order to access MPP V2 do the following steps

check in slack the namespace for the hostname
for example 
db2whoc-flex-performance-bvumifo.services.dal.bluemix.net
check slack namespace found

db2whoc-yp-wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1-m-ibmcdo4

check this link to find out which 
https://github.ibm.com/Watson-and-Cloud-Platform-Support/ACS-Database/blob/master/DB2/AccessMPPV2.md#frankfurt-prod-2
from this link it is  Dallas Prod 1


ibmcloud login -sso â€“ answer one time passcode that appears every login

Select number that corresponds to 1647969 (Option 5 in my case)

ibmcloud ks region-set us-south

ibmcloud cs cluster-config wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1

The above command may return an export statement. If so copy and issue the statement.

To see thst you are in the right direction do 
kubectl get ns | grep ibmcdo4

which will bring this info db2whoc-yp-wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1-m-ibmcdo4     Active   280d

then do kubectl -n db2whoc-yp-wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1-m-ibmcdo4 exec -it dashmpp-head-0 /bin/bash


db2pd - will show the uptime( if database was restarted or not)

log into IBM Cloud, once successful 



db2level
for V1/V2 system to get into root:

sudo su - db2inst1 

db2 connect to bludb (to connect to the database BLUDB)


db2 "select * from sysibm.sysdummy1"  which shows that the database can run basic queries

/opt/ibm/dsserver/scripts/recovery/mgmt_health_check.pl will show health checks but only basic summary
[root@dashmpp-head-0 - Db2wh home]# /opt/ibm/console/production/console-deploy-ops.sh status
will only work in V1 systems

Console issues
for V2 systems
to get the console parameter to run  do first:
chose `dsserver2-596c7fcd64-dmb94` 
kubectl -n db2whoc-yp-wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1-m-jmgqxud get pods -o wide
then run:
kubectl -n db2whoc-yp-wams-db2prod-dal13-dashdb-prod1-m-jmgqxud exec -it dsserver2-596c7fcd64-dmb94 -- status
will show you the console if it working or not



nc -zv db2w-zykwbyp.services.dal.bluemix.net 50000
nc -zv db2w-zykwbyp.services.dal.bluemix.net 443  

shows if host are connectable but does not work for CIAE/HIPAA  but works for public host

we can also check for console status if client is seeing 502 gateway error

/opt/ibm/console/production/console-deploy-ops.sh status


difference in Configuration items:

 dashdb is configuration item for Db2 Warehouse on Cloud (old hosts). 
 For Db2 Warehouse on Cloud  MPPV2 (new hosts) configuration item is db2-warehouse-on-cloud

You mean it is dashdb if the system name begins with "dashdb"  and 
db2-warehouse-on-cloud if the system name begins with "db2whoc" 

there is also third configuration item dashdb-for-transactions. This is also for old hosts (V1) 
but for transactional databases. You will see the txn or thxha string in the hostname
