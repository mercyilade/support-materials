Cloudant NoSQL DB does not completely delete the specified document. 
Instead, it leaves a tombstone with basic information about the document. 
The tombstone is required so that the delete action can be replicated to 
other copies of the database. Since the tombstones stay in the database indefinitely, 
creating new documents and deleting them increases the disk space usage of a database.

2 ways to delete an attachment.
a). By API, make a DELETE request with the document's latest _rev to
https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID/$ATTACHMENT.
b). From dashboard, just remove the content of "_attachments" field and 
then "Save Changes" to the related doc.

As far as I know, if you delete a big attachment or a doc with a big attachment, 
it won't release disk space immediately, instead it will release disk space only 
after auto-compaction(which is a cluster-level setting) has been done on the related database.
