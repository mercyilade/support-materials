When we get a request to move a user from a non eu cluster  to an eu cluster, these steps must be followed or else the
account will experience issues 


1) create a documents for each account in https://bm-cc-eu-de-01.cloudant.com/users 
(based on the documents that already exist for those accounts in https://meritage.cloudant.com/users) 

2) clou user migrate 

3) clou user move

4) delete the documents for each of those accounts from https://meritage.cloudant.com/us

Remember when creating the document remove the rev before creating the doc in https://bm-cc-eu-de-01.cloudant.com/users 
or else it will fail.

go to https://bm-cc-eu-de-01.cloudant.com/dashboard.html#database/users/_all_docs 
create the doc there 

delete the doc from 
https://meritage.cloudant.com/dashboard.html#database/users/_all_docs
