first step in Decomm process:

ensure there is a letter from the project office confirming that the cluster should be decomm

check if there are users in the cluster and if they have data.

send an email asking the users to delete their data from their accounts .

if they want us to delete the data, we asked for explicit approval to delete their accounts. We have a standard
covering letter for that. check 

get approval from Mike Breslin for confirmation of the decomm process

after approval, ask ops to put the cluster in MM

delete all the accounts and databases in the cluster. there is a script provided , add the path in your home directory 
and use it to delete the files.

after that create a ticket with infra for the decomm process to beginn

remove the contact from cloudant.cloudant.com/cluster-contacts  acurl https://cloudant.cloudant.com/cluster-contacts/bluemix-uk-lloyds001

after completing all tasks the cluster can be decomm.
