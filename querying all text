As I understand from the problem description provided, you are indexing all fields within a given database using an index similar to the below.

{
    "type": "text",
    "index": { }
}

Generally speaking, indexing all fields within a database is not recommended (especially for large datasets with many fields and/or documents). Doing so is very resource intensive, and can lead to degraded performance at query time.

To improve your overall query response times, I would first recommend analyzing your workflow and determining which fields are queried with greatest frequency. Then, index on those fields specifically as explained in the 'Creating a "type=text" index' section of the documentation provided below.

Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any questions.
