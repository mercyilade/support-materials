When faced with backup failure in ICD:

Login to the system using 
i ffs crn
i recipes
icdctl y recipe on the failed backups
The results for mongodb:
and amongst the output you can find "Hidden member is not properly 
synced.". This condition will occur from time to time in the normal operation of MongoDB formations. 

When you see "Hidden member is not properly synced." in a recipe result, the next 
thing to do is look to see if the h-0 pod is still syncing, finished syncing, or broken. 

Check this with icdctl mocs

 If the hidden member is in state SECONDARY, then it is healthy and ready for the next backup.
