how to check for views in a database using splunk 

index=payrange002* db_name=vendnext_new_no_auth _view | stats count by db_request | sort count 

This will allow the customer to have a look at his views and see which one to delete in order to free disk space and also check if 
it is worthwhile to keep the views or delete it.
