If a customer complains about rewind, we can check using this splunk parameter:
Changes feed rewinds if a node is rebooted check ops-alerts if there was any nodes reboot

index="dbcore" host="*.qton001" "uuid prefix mismatch"
index="dbcore" host="*.qton001" seq


The changes feed at Cloudant is different to the one you might know from CouchDB (prior to 2.0), because our databases are
sharded and fault-tolerant.

You will always receive every update made after your `since` parameter but the order you receive them in between `_changes` 
calls will not be the same. In addition, it might be necessary for us to send changes from before the `since` parameter 
(this happens if we fail over to a different copy of a shard, if the copy you were previously using became unavailable or lost).

Our sequence values are also different. They are strings encoding the sequences of the underlying shards. You should treat
seq values opaquely and you cannot meaningfully compare them without decoding them. We prefix the sum of the sequence values 
of the underlying shards in order to be compatible with the replicator in older versions of CouchDB.
