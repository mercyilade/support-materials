If you receive a question on changes feed:
you can check for changes feed by using this curl

acurl 'https://mercyilade.cloudant.com/animaldb/_changes' | jq .

you can use the since parameter and the feed parameter so that you don't need to loop through all the changes

 acurl 'https://mercyilade.cloudant.com/animaldb/_changes?feed=continuous&since

The "feed" argument is a great approach to retrieve the updates, but can we use feed with a sequence id
(at least a hardcoded one just to jump the initial data)?
