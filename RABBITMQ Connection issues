If a customer is facing this:
I have a RMQ instance that's currently unreachable
ff4e2c06-8109-400e-8525-2b3108e76707.brjdfmfw09op3teml03g.databases.appdomain.cloud:32680
An error occurred during a connection to ff4e2c06-8109-400e-8525-2b3108e76707.
brjdfmfw09op3teml03g.databases.appdomain.cloud:32680. PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR

we can check https connections, if's high number considering that https should only be used to access the UI or collect some metrics
check if there is any leaking connections on their side. We kill any idle connection after 5 min so they must be issuing keep alive as well
for https is 3x1024, for the rest 3x20000

We can check these and see if the connection is increasing instead of decreasing

i exec c-$ID-m-0 -c mgmt -- curl http://localhost:9901/stats | grep cluster.rmq_http_ssl.circuit_breakers.default.cx_open

Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 34967    0 34967    0     0  2251k     cluster.rmq_http_ssl.circuit_breakers.default.cx_open: 1
 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2439k
 

The result will tell you if there is something wrong with the https connections, in this case the value is 1 
meaning envoy is blocking connections. Then you can check the number with:

i exec c-$ID-m-0 -c mgmt -- curl http://localhost:9901/stats | grep cluster.rmq_http_ssl.upstream_cx_active
will show the number of  connections 

Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0cluster.rmq_http_ssl.upstream_cx_active: 1024
 
100 35011    0 35011    0     0  5451k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 5698k

couple of things to try 

reset the connection you can do i rqrr will perform a rolling restart of the nodes

if the above does not work try 
icdctl cdb-execute envoy_restart

then run this again and check the result:
i exec c-$ID-m-0 -c mgmt -- curl http://localhost:9901/stats | grep cluster.rmq_http_ssl.upstream_cx_active

Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0cluster.rmq_http_ssl.upstream_cx_active: 14
100 34339    0 34339    0     0  2920k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3048k

they need to analyse whatever code is calling the https endpoint and make sure they are closing the connections 
when they are done. We need to limit connections to try and avoid the noisy neighbour issue. Also leaking connections 
will impact their performance as well
